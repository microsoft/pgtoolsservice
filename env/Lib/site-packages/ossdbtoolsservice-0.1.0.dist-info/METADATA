# PostgreSQL Tools Service 
The PostgreSQL Tools Service (pgtoolsservice, or PGTS) is an application that provides core functionality for various PostgreSQL Server tools.
* Connection management
* Language Service support using VS Code protocol
* Query execution and resultset management

It is based on an early version of [Microsoft SQL Tools Service](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqltoolsservice), with some functionality coming from [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) and [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com).

## Servers

There are two servers in PGTS: A RPC server that reads and writes JSON-RPC messages from stdin/stdout, and a web server that reads and writes JSON-RPC messages over HTTP using web sockets.
The web server is used to provide a REST API for the RPC server.
Both servers use messaging defined by the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

## Naming

The project is named `pgtoolsservice`, but there is the name `ossdbtoolsservice` in some places. This reflects a refactor that was done years ago to make the project more generic and support other databases.
However, that refactor was never completed, and the project is still PostgreSQL specific. The name `ossdbtoolsservice` will be removed in a future release.
