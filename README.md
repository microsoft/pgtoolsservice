## Developing the PostgreSQL Tools Service
1. Ensure that Python2.7 or above is installed - Python3 is supported (you will have to use python3 or pip3 in place of python or pip commands in this guide)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root of the project
    - If you need to install pip, see [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/]()

## Running Tests
### Python 3
1. `python3 -m unittest` (from the project's base directory)

### Python 2.7
1. `pip install nose`
2. `nosetests` (from the project's base directory)

## Manual Testing
1. `python pgsqltoolsservice/server.py`
2. Now you can pass in JSON RPC requests to stdin, following the [language server protocol specifications](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md). The following commands are supported currently:
    - initialize
    - connection/connect
    - connection/disconnect
    - shutdown
    - exit
